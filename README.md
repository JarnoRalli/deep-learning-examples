# Deep Learning Examples

This is a collection of deep learning examples, tests and related material. Some of the examples are based on courses and tests I've done
along the years, which I'd like to mention here:

* [Deep Learning (Coursera)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning?)
* [Deep Learning: Advanced Computer Vision by Lazy Programmer (Udemy)](https://www.udemy.com/course/advanced-computer-vision)
* [Deep Learning: Financial Engineering and Artificial Intelligence in Python](https://deeplearningcourses.com/c/ai-finance)

All of the above are fantastic courses and if you're interested in those subjects, you should consider taking them.

# Folder Structure

* **[Conda](./conda/README.md)** contains files for creating Conda virtual environments for running the examples
  * Lately I have had issues with miniconda in Ubuntu 20.04, so I'm moving away from Conda
* **[Docker](./docker/README.md)** contains files for creating Docker container for running the examples
* **[Virtualenv](./virtualenv/README.md)** instructions for setting up virtual environments using `virtualenv`
* **[TensorFlow](./TensorFlow/README.md)** deep learning examples using TensorFlow 2
* **[FinancialEngineering](./FinancialEngineering/README.md)** financial engineering using Python and Ai

# Testing Environment

Testing and executing the examples has been done in a system with the following characteristics:

* **OS** Ubuntu 20.04
* **GPU** GeForce GTX 1070

# Running the Examples

You can either create a Conda virtual environment, or a Docker container, for running the examples. In order to do so,
take a look at the instructions in [conda](./conda/README.md) and [docker](./docker/README.md) directories.
