# Conda Virtual Environments

* **tensorflow2_gpu.yml** installs TensorFlow 2 with GPU support
* **tensorflow_object_detection.yml** installs a TensorFlow 2 environment where the Object Detection API can be installed

You can create a new virtual environment as follows:

conda env create -f tensorflow2_gpu.yml
```
