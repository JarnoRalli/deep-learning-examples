    "# Masked Language Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the bidirectional nature of BERT (Birectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) models, words can be \"masked\" in the middle of a sentence and then the model generates possible replacements for the masked words, taking into account the whole sentence. In a sense this is similar to image denoising autoencoder where we encode and then decode the the input and try to reconstruct the original input signal without noise. We add \"noise\" by removing information from the text by replacing words with tokens (in this case with a `<mask>` token), and then we try to \"denoise\" the sentence by guessing what is the most likely word.

      "Bombardier chief to leave company\n",
      "\n",
      "Shares in train passenger plane-making giant Bombardier have fallen to a 10-year low following the departure of its chief executive and two members of the board.\n",
      "Paul Tellier, who was also Bombardier's president, left the company amid an ongoing restructuring.\n",
      "Laurent Beaudoin, part of the family that owns the Montreal-based firm, will take on the role of CEO under a newly created management structure.\n",
      "Analysts said the resignations seem to have stemmed from a personal dispute.\n",
      "Under Mr Tellier's tenure at the company, which began in January 2003, plans to cut the worldwide workforce of 75,000 by almost a third by 2006 were announced\n",
      "The Airbus snowmobile division and defence services unit were also sold and Bombardier started the development of a new aircraft seating 110 to 135 passengers.\n",
      "Mr Tellier had indicated he wanted to stay at the world's top train maker and third largest manufacturer of civil aircraft until the restructuring was complete.\n",
      "But Bombardier has been hit with a declining share price and profits.\n",
      "Earlier this month the firm said it earned $10m (£19.2m) in the third quarter, down from a peak of $133m a year ago.\n",
      "\"I understand the board's concern that I would not be there for the long-term and the need to develop and implement strategies, and the need to reshape the management structure at this time,\" Mr Tellier said in a statement on Monday.\n",
      "Bombardier said restructuring plans drawn up by Mr Tellier's would continue to be implemented.\n",
      "Shares in Bombardier lost 65 Canadian cents or 25% on the news to 1.90 Canadian dollars before recovering to 2.20 Canadian dollars.\n",
