    "# Multi Layer Perceptron NLP Model by Bengio, Manual Back-propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an implementation of a character level NLP model, motivated by [Bengio et al.](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf) paper, based on Andrej Karpathy's [Makemore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCH_1BHY58I&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ&index=3) lectures.\n",

    ", where $w_t$ is the t-th word, and $w_i^j = \\left(w_i, w_{i+1}, \\ldots, w_{j-1}. w_j\\right)$ is a sequence of words from $i$ to $j$. Since in this example we will teach a neural network to generate names based on examples, instead of using words, we use characters. This version uses batch normalization in order to deal with the gradient vanishing problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Manual Back-propagation\n",
    "\n",
    "This version shows how the backpropagation can be done manually without using PyTorch's autograd.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Input to the Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The input to the model is a sequence of n-characters (we use 3 in the code). These characters are converted into a 2D embedding space using a look-up-table C. LUT is part of the nn model, so the weights for the LUT are learned. The rationale for using a learned embedding space is for the model to be able to generalize better, especially when it comes across input that is has not seen previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Output from the Model \n",
    "\n",
    "For each combination of 3 input characters, the model outputs a probability distribution for the 27 letters from the alphabet. Using the probability distribution we can sample letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loss Function\n",
    "\n",
    "We need a way of measuring how well the model is doing so that the deep-learning model can learn based on the given examples. In order to do so, we need a loss function. We start by defining the likelihood function. Likelihood function is the joint probability of the observed data viewed as a function of the parameters of a statistical model (source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likelihood_function)). In statistics, maximum likelihood estimation is a method of estimating the parameters of an assumed probability distribution, given observed data. For a set of independent and identically distributed points $X = \\{x_1, x_2,..., x_n\\}$, the likelihood is defined as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}(\\theta|x)=p(X|\\theta)=\\prod_{n=1}^{N}p(x_n|\\theta)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathcal{L}(\\theta|x)$ is the likelihood function, $\\theta$ are the model parameters and $x$ are the observations. We want to maximize the likelihood of the data with respect to the parameters. In other words, we want to maximize the likelihood, by tweaking the parameters $\\theta$, that the model produces the observed data. Since we have many bigrams, we want to maximize the likelihood over all of them, which leads to a product over all of the probabilities. Since the probability for each individual observation is between $[0...1]$, multiplying these together leads to a small number and numerical instabilities. Therefore, we want to maximize the log-likelihood. Since $log(a \\cdot b)=log(a)+log(b)$, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$log\\left(\\mathcal{L}(\\theta|x)\\right)=\\sum_{n=1}^{N}log\\left(p(x_n|\\theta)\\right)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The way we train deep-learning networks is by minizing a loss function. Maximizing the log-likelihood is equivalent to minimizing the negative log-likelihood, and in order for the results to be comparable regardless the number of data points we are using, we normalize the negative log-likelihood by dividing it with the number of data points we have. Therefore, our loss function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$-\\dfrac{1}{N}\\sum_{n=1}^{N}log\\left(p(x_n|\\theta)\\right)$$"
