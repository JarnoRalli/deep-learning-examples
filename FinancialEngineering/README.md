# Financial Engineering

Some of the examples use data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). In order to automatically download the data, you need to create
an account in Kaggle and create an [API key](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api). `opendatasets` uses the Kaggle API to download 
datasets. For more information, take a look at [here](https://github.com/JovianHQ/opendatasets/blob/master/README.md#kaggle-credentials).
